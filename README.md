# Model-Analysis

Note that this is a Legacy repository, so there may be some duplicated files.

These files are matlab files used to analyze STL models. These functions were used to analyze 3D models of the aorta. Some files are just used for parsing the 3D models into datapoints and others are used for analyzing/plotting the data from the arrays. The main function is the "Quadrant_Division" function which divides the model into quadrants based on anatomical location.

The main use of the functions is for 3D image analysis.
